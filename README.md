## Project Overview

The MBTA Finder Web App is a Python-based application developed using the Flask framework, designed to help users locate the nearest MBTA station based on a provided address or place name within the Greater Boston area. By integrating the Mapbox Geocoding API and the MBTA-realtime API, the app converts user-input locations into geographic coordinates and retrieves information about nearby transit stations, including details on wheelchair accessibility. Additionally, it integrates OpenWeather API to include weather, temperature, and humidity data.

The main objectives of this project were to practice connecting to web APIs, processing JSON data, and building a simple web application with dynamic content. Users interact with the app through a straightforward web interface where they can enter a location and receive immediate information about the closest MBTA station. The MBTA Finder Web App was developed using Flask, integrating Mapbox and MBTA APIs to provide geolocation and transit data. The process went smoothly overall, with effective API integration and dynamic content rendering. Debugging challenges, such as handling API errors and edge cases like invalid inputs, were resolved through iterative testing and detailed logging. Planning for error handling earlier could have improved efficiency, but overall, the workflow was smooth and productive.

## Reflection
The project was completed as a team, with each member working at different times to maximize productivity. This approach ensured steady progress and allowed us to focus on our respective strengths. The work division was clear and well-executed, with regular updates to maintain alignment. This flexibility in collaboration made the development process efficient and enjoyable, with no major issues arising for the initial parts.

The project enhanced our skills in web development, API integration, and JSON data processing. Working collaboratively refined our communication and task management abilities. For part 3, we were encountering issues with loading our API Key from the OpenWeather API, for that we resorted to AI, which wasn't very helpful, but was able to help us include cool features in our code such as Temperature, Conditions, and Humidity percentage. Following that, we reached out to professor Li via Slack who assisted us in ensuring our API key was properly loading. Overall, while this forced us to think outside of the box, it was a fun activity that pushed us and helped us get some additional information for our code.
